# myTube

This is a project i made to learn the React, Express and Mongoose frameworks. It is a youtube video playlist maker where i have a simple page
that is able to do CRUD operations with a mongoDB database. You can access the site in this link https://my-tubee.vercel.app/home.

When you click in the link you will be directed to the login page

But to start creating playlists you must create an account first so click in the info button located in the top-right corner of the page. This button
will open an modal with a brief explanation of what the site is

Click in the create account button to access the create account page

In the create user page type your username and your password two times. If everything goes right you'll see the user created successfully warning
in a pop-up modal. Now click in the login button in the top-right corner to go back to the login page and type your username and password in the fields. When you click 
in the login button with the correct username and password you will be redirected to the home page.

Now in the home page you can create your playlists. To add a video to a playlist you must open the modal clicking the red rounded button located in the right of the screen.
After you click you must copy a url from a youtube video

![CopyLinkExample](https://github.com/Chel0per/myTube/assets/115203217/3f2c3c2b-f615-4589-8c11-a75cf5771ca9)

Paste the link in the Url input form and type the name that you desire for you playlist. If the playlist already exists in your site the video will be added to that playlist,
if not another playlist will be created and the video will be added to it. If everything goes right a pop-up warning will show in the top of the screen with the warning "video added successfully"

![AddVideoExample](https://github.com/Chel0per/myTube/assets/115203217/fa46dfa3-7a14-4cce-8872-1b70cccf9390)

You can delete videos and update their title by hovering through their thumbnails and clicking in the red buttons that will appear and also you can delete an entire playlist by clicking in the "X" button next to its name. Aditionally you can use the navbar as a filter to find your videos. That's basically it, hope you like it!
